Trailblaze is a Tinder-style mobile application created to connect hikers with the best views offered by British Columbian trails.

This project was made for CPEN 291 Computer Engineering Design Studio I in May 2021, and was created by Andrew Forde, Taylor Mcouat, Leo Sun, and Jayden Wong.

For a summary of the project, details on the project components, and more, see the 'CPEN 291 - Final Report' document in Trailblaze/reports/final.
